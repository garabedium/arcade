# Classic Arcade Game Clone

### How it works
This Frogger clone runs on plain javascript. Engine.js is the game loop that continually renders the objects. Resources.js is the image loading utility that also caches images for performance purposes. App.js contains the game logic and instantiates the objects (enemies and player).

### How to play
Download the repo to your desktop and open the index.html file in your browser. Use your keyboard directional arrows to move around the board and reach the water.

### Game highlights
- Gain points every time you reach the water.
- Lose points every time you hit a bug.
